# BroadbandBasics
Created for the HACC 2022.

## Inspiration 
The internet is essential in today’s tech-centric society. But what would you do if you didn’t know how to access it? Have you ever had someone ask you for help regarding the internet? Grandparents? Children? How would you teach them the basics behind how the internet works? Where would you even start? Our website aims to answer these questions and more.  

## What it does 
BroadbandBasics teaches people about broadband in a simple, easy-to-understand way, in order to attract and be accessible to all groups of people. Our application provides information on various internet-related topics and has quizzes at the end of each lesson, to make learning fun and to find which topics we can improve on teaching to users. 

BroadbandBasics also comes with a database. With the information collected from the quizzes, we can statistically analyze which questions users get right or wrong. With this information, we hope to locate which internet topics we need to improve on. 

## How we built it 
To access the BroadbandBasics website, the only thing required is an internet connection and the URL link.  
We used HTML and CSS to create the design.
We used JavaScript for the quiz functionality. 
We used node.js & MongoDB to create and connect the database of the quiz answers. 
We used Netlify to deploy the site. 

## Challenges we ran into 
One of the challenges we ran into was merging conflicts on GitHub. It was the first time using GitHub for a lot of our team members. So, we had git & GitHub training to get into a smooth workflow.

Another challenge we ran into was adding a database. Initially, BroadbandBasics was not going to have a database, but we decided that being able to see the results of users would be incredibly beneficial for admins. A week before the submission deadline, we started to implement a database. 
 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of 
One accomplishment that we’re proud of is connecting a database to the question 

Another accomplishment we’re proud of is the amount of work we did in a short period of time. For many of our team members, this hackathon was the first hackathon they have ever participated. We utilized the powers of teamwork and communication to 

## What we learned 
Although our experience levels may vary, it’s been a learning experience for all of us. We’ve pushed ourselves to learn:  
How to use GitHub efficiently as a team. 
How to use node.js & MongoDB.

## What's next for VGDSquared 
In the future, we plan to continue adding content to BroadbandBasics. We already have the foundations made with the visuals and quizzes functional, so adding more information to learn shouldn’t be too difficult. 

# How to run
## Prerequisites
1. Have npm and Node.js installed. 
2. Run the following commands <br>
```
npm install 
node index.js
```
`npm install` does not need to be ran every time. It is used to install all the necessary dependencies to run this project. Ideally you should be running this command every time you run the project after you pull from another branch. <br>
`node index.js` actually serves the app.
3. Go to http://localhost:8080/ in the browser :)
